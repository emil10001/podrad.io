PodRad.io is a very simple podcast client, which allows you to subscribe to various podcasts and consume them. 

If you are coming from the Google Developer's Live presentation, there are two important branches that you should be looking at instead of master: 

* [Pre-Chrome App Conversion](https://github.com/emil10001/podrad.io/tree/pre_chrome_update_presentation)
* [Post-Chrome App Conversion](https://github.com/emil10001/podrad.io/tree/chrome_angular_presentation)

You can also now [install this as a Chrome App](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/edit/fikgabkmkaknnlacpgpbdgmmpeoniddp)!

It's being developed using the AngularJS library, using Yeoman, Grunt and Bower.

There is a detailed technical walk-through of this code on my blog, [RecursiveRobot](http://www.recursiverobot.com/post/53058750794/code-walk-through-of-podrad-io).
