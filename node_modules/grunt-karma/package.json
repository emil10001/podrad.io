  "readme": "#grunt-karma\nGrunt plugin for [Karma](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma)\nNOTE: this plugin requires Grunt 0.4.x\n\n##Getting Started\nFrom the same directory as your project's Gruntfile and package.json, install this plugin with the following command:\n\n`npm install grunt-karma --save-dev`\n\nOnce that's done, add this line to your project's Gruntfile:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-karma');\n```\n\n##Config\nInside your `Gruntfile.js` file, add a section named *karma*, containing any number of configurations for running karma. The only required option is the path to the [karma config file](http://karma-runner.github.com/0.8/config/configuration-file.html). Here's a simple example:\n\n```js\nkarma: {\n  unit: {\n    configFile: 'karma.conf.js'\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can override any of the config file's settings directly:\n\n```js\nkarma: {\n  unit: {\n    configFile: 'karma.conf.js',\n    runnerPort: 9999,\n    singleRun: true,\n    browsers: ['PhantomJS']\n  }\n}\n```\n\n##Sharing Configs\nIf you have multiple targets, it may be helpful to share common configuration settings between them. Grunt-karma supports this by using the `options` property:\n\n```js\nkarma: {\n  options: {\n    configFile: 'karma.conf.js',\n    runnerPort: 9999,\n    browsers: ['Chrome', 'Firefox']\n  },\n  continuous: {\n    singleRun: true\n    browsers: ['PhantomJS']\n  },\n  dev: {\n    reporters: 'dots'\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example the `continuous` and `dev` targets will both use the `configFile` and `runnerPort` specified in the `options`. But the `continuous` target will override the browser setting to use PhantomJS, and also run as a singleRun. The `dev` target will simply change the reporter to dots.\n\n##Running tests\nThere are three ways to run your tests with karma:\n\n###Karma Server with Auto Runs on File Change\nSetting the `autoWatch` option to true will instruct karma to start a server and watch for changes to files, running tests automatically:\n\n```js\nkarma: {\n  unit: {\n    configFile: 'karma.conf.js',\n    autoWatch: true\n  }\n}\n```\nNow run `$ grunt karma`\n\nHowever, usually Grunt projects watch many types of files using [grunt-contrib-watch](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch) or [grunt-regarde](https://github.com/yeoman/grunt-regarde), so this option isn't preferred. \n\n###Karma Server with Grunt Watch/Regarde\nConfig karma like usual (without the autoWatch option):\n\n```js\nkarma: {\n  unit: {\n    configFile: 'karma.conf.js'\n  }\n}\n```\n\nConfig your `watch` or `regarde` task to run the karma task with the `:run` flag. For example:\n\n```js\nwatch: {\n  //run unit tests with karma (server needs to be already running)\n  karma: {\n    files: ['app/js/**/*.js', 'test/browser/**/*.js'],\n    tasks: ['karma:unit:run'] //NOTE the :run flag\n  }\n},\n```\n\nIn one terminal window start the karma server by running `$ grunt karma:unit`. In another terminal window start grunt watch by running `$ grunt watch`. Now when grunt watch detects a change to one of those files, it will run the tests specified in the `unit` target using the already running karma server. This is the preferred method for development.  \n\n###Single Run\nKeeping a browser window & karma server running during development is productive, but not a good solution for build processes. For that reason karma provides a \"continuous integration\" mode, which will launch the specified browser(s), run the tests, and close the browser(s). It also supports running tests in [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/), a headless webkit browser which is great for running tests as part of a build. To run tests in continous integration mode just add the `singleRun` option:\n\n```js\nkarma: {\n  unit: {\n    configFile: 'config/karma.conf.js',\n  },\n  //continuous integration mode: run tests once in PhantomJS browser.\n  continuous: {\n    configFile: 'config/karma.conf.js',\n    singleRun: true,\n    browsers: ['PhantomJS']\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThe build would then run `grunt karma:continuous` to start PhantomJS, run tests, and close PhantomJS.\n\n##License\nMIT License",
